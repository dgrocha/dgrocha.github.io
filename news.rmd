<left>**Aug 2019:** Since 2016, we have conducted mammal surveys in collaboration with protected area managers within the southern Brazilian Amazonia savannah regions. To our surprise, we encountered species well outside their current known distribution. One of these was the pampas deer, which is listed as Vulnerable in the Brazilian Red List of Threatened Species. More recently, our friend and videographer Laurie Hedges joined us in an expedition to document the pampas deer in the southern Amazonian savannahs. Among the exceptional footage that Laurie captured was the region’s first record of the globally Endangered crowned solitary eagle, another unexpected species for this region. For more information, click on the savanna photo (on the right) to see a short video about these new discoveries.

**Feb 2019:** We have just completed our camera trap survey at Samuel Ecological Station (SEE). Besides being the first systematic survey on medium and large-sized mammals within SEE, this study aimed to understand the impacts of the hydroelectric dam reservoir on the mammal community in the continuous forest adjacent to the reservoir. Lucas Gonçalves and Felipe Pessoa joined the field trip to conduct bat survey. This study was funded by The Alongside Wildlife Foundation, University of California-Davis and SEDAM-Rondônia.
